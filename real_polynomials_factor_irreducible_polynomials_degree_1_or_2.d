# Real coefficients polynomials can always factor into irreducible polynomials of degree 1 or 2.

This is a direct consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:

Any non constant complex polynomial can be factored into monomials. If the polynomial is real, then every complex root also have a its conjugate as root, because:

$$a \in \mathbb{C}$$
